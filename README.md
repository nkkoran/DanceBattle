# TikTok Dance Trainer
Learn to be the very best tik tokker of all.

The main focus of our project is creating opportunities for people to interact virtually and pursue their interests while remaining active. We hoped to accomplish this through a medium that people are already interested in and providing them with a tool to take that interest to the next level. 

TikTok Dance Trainer is a new Web App that enables its users to learn and replicate popular dances from TikTok. While using the app, users will receive a score in real time that gives them feedback on how well they are dancing compared to the original video. This web app is an encouraging way for beginners to hone dance skills and improve their TikTok content as well as a fun way for advanced users to compete against one another in perfecting dances.
